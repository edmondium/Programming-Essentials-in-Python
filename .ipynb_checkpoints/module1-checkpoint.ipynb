    "# Why should you learn PYTHON?\n",
    "Python is omnipresent, and many people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. There have been millions (well, actually billions) of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. What's more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to learn - the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; this means that it's possible to start the actual programming faster;\n",
    "- It is easy to use for writing new software - it's often possible to write code faster when using Python;\n",
    "- It is easy to obtain, install and deploy - Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this course can be a stepping-stone to learning any other programming language, and to exploring technologies using Python as a foundation (e.g., Django). The course is distinguished by its affordability, friendliness, and openness to the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part starts from the absolute basics, guiding you step-by-step to complex problems explained in part 2, making you a responsible software creator able to take on different challenges in many positions in the IT industry.\n",

    "- divide the former value by the latter and store the result in the memory;\n",

    "A language is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts. There are many languages all around us. Some of them require neither speaking nor writing, such as body language; it's possible to express your deepest feelings very precisely without saying a word.\n",

    "# What makes a language?\n",
    "We can say that each language (machine or natural, it doesn't matter) consists of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an **alphabet**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language (e.g., the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic alphabet for Russian, Kanji for Japanese, and so on)\n",
    "- a **lexis**: (aka a dictionary) a set of words the language offers its users (e.g., the word \"computer\" comes from the English language dictionary, while \"cmoptrue\" doesn't; the word \"chat\" is present both in English and French dictionaries, but their meanings are different)\n",
    "- a **syntax**: a set of rules (formal or informal, written or felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence (e.g., \"I am a python\" is a syntactically correct phrase, while \"I a python am\" isn't)\n",
    "- **semantics**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense (e.g., \"I ate a doughnut\" makes sense, but \"A doughnut ate me\" doesn't)\n",
    "\n",
    "The IL is, in fact, **the alphabet of a machine language**. This is the simplest and most primary set of symbols we can use to give commands to a computer. It's the computer's mother tongue.\n",

These languages enable humans to express commands to computers that are much more complex than those offered by ILs.\n",

    "Computer programming is the act of composing the selected programming language's elements in the order that will cause the desired effect. The effect could be different in every specific case - it's up to the programmer's imagination, knowledge and experience.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **alphabetically** - a program needs to be written in a recognizable script, such as Roman, Cyrillic, etc.\n",
    "- **lexically** - each programming language has its dictionary and you need to master it; thankfully, it's much simpler and smaller than the dictionary of any natural language;\n",
    "- **syntactically** - each language has its rules and they must be obeyed;\n",
    "- **semantically** - the program has to make sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's assume that you've successfully written a program. How do we persuade the computer to execute it? You have to render your program into machine language. Luckily, the translation can be done by a computer itself, making the whole process fast and efficient.\n",

    "<span style=\"background-color: black; color: white\"><b>COMPILATION</b></span> - the source program is translated once (however, this act must be repeated each time you modify the source code) by getting a file (e.g., an .exe file if the code is intended to be run under MS Windows) containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a compiler or translator;\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: white; background-color: black\"><b>INTERPRETATION</b></span> - you (or any user of the code) can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code every time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it.\n",

    "# What does the interpreter actually do?\n",
    "Let's assume once more that you have written a program. Now, it exists as a **computer file**: a computer program is actually a piece of text, so the source code is usually placed in **text files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it has to be **pure text**, without any decorations like different fonts, colors, embedded images or other media. Now you have to invoke the interpreter and let it read your source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter reads the source code in a way that is common in Western culture: from top to bottom and from left to right. There are some exceptions - they'll be covered later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the interpreter checks if all subsequent lines are correct (using the four aspects covered earlier).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the compiler finds an error, it finishes its work immediately. The only result in this case is an **error message**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter will inform you where the error is located and what caused it. However, these messages may be misleading, as the interpreter isn't able to follow your exact intentions, and may detect errors at some distance from their real causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you try to use an entity of an unknown name, it will cause an error, but the error will be discovered in the place where it tries to use the entity, not where the new entity's name was introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the actual reason is usually located a little earlier in the code, for example, in the place where you had to inform the interpreter that you were going to use the entity of the name.\n",

    "</center>\n",

    "\n",
    "It is also possible that a significant part of the code may be executed successfully before the interpreter finds an error. This is normal behavior in this execution model.\n",
